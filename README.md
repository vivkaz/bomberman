# Reinforcement Learning Agent

As a final project for the course Fundamentals of Machine Learning (winter semester 21/22), we were asked to train a reinforcement learning agent to play a version of the classical game Bomberman.
<!---The game framework can be found [here](https://github.com/ukoethe/bomberman_rl).--->
